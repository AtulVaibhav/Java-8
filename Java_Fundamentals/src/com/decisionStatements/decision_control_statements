Decision Control Statement:
: based on condition,execution happened

1.if, if-else, if-else if-else(if-else ladder)
 : if(condition){}=> if condition is true,block will execute
 : if-else
   if(condition){}else{}=>if condition is true,if block will execute
                          otherwise else block will execute
                          
 if(condition 1) - else if(condition 2) -else
 if condition-1 fails it will check condition-2,if this fails also then 
 only it will go to else
 
 Nested if:
 
 User input:
 Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
 integer value = sc.nextInt();
 String value = sc.next();
 
 
 Loops: iteration
 1.for loop:
 - it is called as pre-check
 - when we know number of iteration(finite number of iteration)
 - Syntax:
    for(initialization; condition ; update){
        //body of loop;
        }
- minimum number of execution : 0
  Nested for :
    
   
 2.while loop:
 it is called as pre-check
 when we don't know exact of iteration then we will while loop
 Syntax:
    initialize;
    while(condition){
    
        //body
        
        update;
        }
 minimum number of execution :0      
 
 3.do-while:
 -minimum number of execution  :1
 -Syntax:
    do{
        //body 
      update;  
      }while(condition);
 -it's called post-check
